# Stationary Management System
This is a Python School Project I worked on, which covered basic OOP concepts and sorting algorithms

This console application helps the staff of a company, specialising in stationary retail, better manage their business

## How to use
(1). Add a new Stationary

(2). Display all Stationary

(3). Sort Stationary via Bubble Sort on Category

(4). Sort Stationary via Insertion Sort on Brand

(9). Populate data

(0). Exit program

## Notes
- **Option 9 (Populate data)** simply resets the stored data to test-data, to test out the sorting algorithms
- **Option 2 (Display all Stationary)** displays the Stationary in the last sorted format
- If no sorting was done, **Option 2 (Display all Stationary)** displays the Stationary in the order they were added
